        <h2>Hi there, I'm Christa!</h2>
        <p class="about-text">I was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. In August of 2010, I picked up and moved
        to St. Louis for college. I spent five years at Washington University in St. Louis getting my Bachelor's and Master's
      degree in Electrical Engineering. In November of 2014, I met the most amazing man, Dylan, who was in his third year
    of medical school at St. Louis University. We got married in May of 2016 and a week later packed our bags and moved to
  San Diego for Dylan's intern year in family medicine with the Navy.<br><br>Long story short, in May 2018 the Navy moved us to
Ridgecrest, CA, a sleepy little town in the middle of the Mojave Desert. We like to say we're in the middle of nowhere but
in the middle of everything. We're about an hour south of Mt. Whitney, the highest mountain in the contiguous US. We're about
an hour and a half east of Death Valley, which contains the lowest point in the US. We're about two hours south of Bishop, CA,
a mecca for rock climbers, fishermen, and hikers. And, we're about two and a half hours south of Mammoth Lakes, CA, which is
home to Mammoth Mountain.<br><br>After moving, we quickly found ourselves escaping to the Eastern
Seirras every moment we could get. Our summers are spent hiking and backpacking under beautiful pines and next to pristine
alpine lakes. Our falls and springs are spent rock climbing and fishing in the Owens River Gorge, home to California's most
concentrated sport-climbing area. Our winters are spent on the slopes of Mammoth. Our energetic French Pointer, Louis,
tags along on all of our adventures (except skiing of course). My hope for this website is to share a tiny slice of the beauty
of the Eastern Sierra with you! Enjoy!<br><br></p>
